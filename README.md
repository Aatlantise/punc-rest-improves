# punctuation-restoration-for-structure-understanding

This is our code that accompanies our RepL4NLP Paper 
[Punctuation restoration improves structure understanding without supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08382), 
where we apply punctuation restoration as an unsupervised structure learning objective 
that complements masked language modeling in T5 models. 
The additional training in punctuation restoration results in
improved in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance in various structure-related NLP tasks
such as named entity recognition, open information extraction, and semantic role labeling.
